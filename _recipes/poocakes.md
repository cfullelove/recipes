# Ingredients

- 1 3/4 cup milk
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla essence
- 2 cups self raising flour
- 1/3 cup caster sugar

# Method
1. Whisk eggs, milk and vanilla together in a jug. Sift flour into a large bowl. Stir in sugar. Make a well in the centre. Add milk mixture. Whisk until just combined.
2. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Grease pan with butter or spray with cooking oil. Using 1/4 cup mixture per pancake, cook 2 pancakes for 2 minutes or until bubbles appear on surface. Turn and cook for a further 1-2 minutes or until cooked through. Transfer to a plate. Cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining mixture, greasing pan with butter or cooking oil between batches.
3. Serve with butter and maple syrup (and ice cream, obviously).
