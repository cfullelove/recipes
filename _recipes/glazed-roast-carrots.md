The most amazing quick and easy roasted carrots! Roasting brings out the best in carrots, always. And the caramelised edges are the BEST - it's the only way I make Glazed Carrots!

# Summary

* **Prep Time**: 10 minutes
* **Cook Time**: 25 minutes
* **Total Time**: 35 minutes
* **Servings**: 5 as a side


# Ingredients

- 1 kg / 2 lb carrots , peeled (Note 1)
- 1/4 cup (40g) brown sugar , loosely packed (Note 2)
- 2 garlic cloves , minced
- 2 tbsp butter (30g) , melted (or olive oil)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- Parsley , for garnish (optional)

## Gravy

- 2 tbsp flour
- 2 cups / 500 ml beef broth (or 1 cup red wine + 1 cup water)
- Salt and pepper

# Method

1. Preheat oven to 220C/425F (standard) or 200C/400F (fan).
1. Cut carrot on the diagonal into 4cm / 1.75” lengths. Halve thicker end so they are all roughly the same width.
1. Toss in a bowl with sugar, butter, garlic, oil, salt and pepper. Pour onto tray, spread out.
1. Roast 15 minutes. Toss, then roast a further 10 minutes until soft and caramelised on the edges with plenty of glaze left on the tray.
1. Toss carrots in the glaze, sprinkle with parsley if using. Serve warm.

## Notes

* Nice holiday touch is to add ½ tsp of cinnamon! For a kick, add cayenne pepper.
1. Carrots - use any type of carrots. Baby, dutch, purple or standard (as I have done)
2. Sugar - Can be substituted with honey or maple syrup, and can reduce down to 1 tbsp.
