The most amazing SUPER SPEEDY way to prepare fresh green beans!! Tender crisp garlic green beans with terrific crunch from breadcrumbs and savoury from parmesan. Be prepared to fight over the little parmesan wafers - the are the gold nuggets!!

# Summary

* **Prep Time**: 5 minutes
* **Cook Time**: 15 minutes
* **Total Time**: 20 minutes
* **Servings**: 4 - 5 people


# Ingredients

- 500 g / 1 lb green beans , ends trimmed
- 2 tbsp olive oil , separated
- 2 garlic cloves , finely chopped
- 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper
- 1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs (Note 1)
- 1/3 cup grated parmesan (Note 2)

# Method

1. Preheat oven to 220C/425F OR the broiler/grill on high with the shelf about 30cm/12" from the heat source.
1. Pile beans on a tray. Drizzle with 1 tbsp of the oil, garlic, salt and pepper. Toss.
1. Line up on the tray, pushing the beans next to each other (I do 2 rows).
1. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs then parmesan. Drizzle with remaining oil.
1. Roast for 15 minutes or broil/grill for 8 minutes until the parmesan is golden.
1. Use a spatula/egg flip to transfer beans to serving platter. Serve immediately!

## Notes

1. Panko Breadcrumbs are larger than normal breadcrumbs so you get terrific crunch. OR make your own!
2. Parmesan - I use store bought grated parmesan, the sandy type from the fridge section of grocery stores. If grating your own, use about double (because volume is greater for same weight)
